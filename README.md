# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was a company who wanted to help people pass DMV driving and written test but creating a system that would allow customers to signup for packages that could provide driving lessons and online tests.

What did you do particularly well?


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The gantt chart in the business requirements document in particular could use revision. It needs to be formatted better and show which steps are needed for following steps to happen, and which can be completed indpendently.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

User needs were determined by first reviewing an interview with the client, and creating functional and nonfunctional requirements from the interview. If we fail to consider the needs of a user the system will not be able to be used for the clients vision.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I first want to understand what the software is intended to do, and from there breakdown what the system needs to do this. I will continue to use client interviews and communication to start a system analysis, and use different UML diagrams when needed to provide a better base to begin development from.
